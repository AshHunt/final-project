                  <p>Back in 2014, Cheryl Gordon had an idea to start her own jewelry business. She wanted to create custom pieces that meant something, so the anyone could wear their loves and interests on their sleeve(pun intended). 
                    She began investing her time into learning lampwork beading, and it took off from there. Starting with charm bracelets, she branched off into necklaces, keychains, and more. Gordon has sold many of her pieces through word of mouth and she also grew her business by participating in craft shows all over St. Louis. When it came time to come up with a name for her company, it was a no-brainer. Her mother Lucille, loved all things that sparkled. The class, elegance, and love that went into 
                    Cheryl's work were reminiscent of who Lucille was. Cheryl has expanded her productd to all types of jewelry, for people of all ages, and if there's something near and dear to you, you can bet Loving Lucille has the bead to represent that for you.
